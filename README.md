# What is it?

This website template was developed based on TailWindCss 3. The concept of this template is related to the simple Real State Website. every branch represents separate components, so in order to know what code is developed on every part of the template I recommend it follow the branches, and the final branch is the completed version of this template.

# How to execute?

- For the test purpose on _vs code_ install **Live Server** and before anything run `npm i`.
- If you modify any style run `npm run build`
